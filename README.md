Still a WIP!

This config was inspired by the beautiful Rouge Theme for VSCode by [Josef](https://github.com/josefaidt), in particular his extra cozy theme known as rogue 2.

This rice aims to produce a practical work environment that will hopefully complement the calm and comfortable feel of the original Rouge theme.
